# Welcome to the ValheimPlus Installer

Installs and updates the Valheim+ Mod files from any folder where you have the Valheim game installed.

## Current Features

- Can update itself when a new version of the installer is available
- Always looks for and installs the latest Stable version of Valheim+
  - Fresh install of the Mod if it's not already installed
  - Will update an existing installation of Valheim+
    Caution: Currently overwrites your existing CFG file (save it first!)

## Roadmap

### Full CFG editor

- Retains current values before applying mod updates
- Shows new options that may have been added or changed
- Edit all options and save before launching the game
- Verifies CFG files, so no more silly CFG errors

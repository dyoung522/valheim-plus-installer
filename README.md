# Welcome to the ValheimPlus Installer

Installs and updates the Valheim+ Mod files from any folder where you have the Valheim game installed.

## Current Features

- Supports multiple Valheim game folders
- Can update itself when a new version of the installer is available
- Always looks for and installs the latest Stable version of Valheim+
  - Fresh install of the Mod if it's not already installed
  - Will update an existing installation of Valheim+

### Full CFG editor

- Retains current values before applying mod updates
- Edit all options and save before launching the game

## Roadmap

- Show new options that may have been added or changed
- Validate/Verify CFG files -- no more silly CFG errors (kinda already does this, but not elegantly)

# Welcome to the ValheimPlus Installer

Installs and updates the Valheim+ Mod files from any folder where you have the Valheim game installed.

## Current Features

- Launch Valheim straight from the App
- Can update itself when a new version of the installer is available
- Supports custom Valheim game install folders (defaults to your Steam install dir)
- Always looks for and installs the latest Stable version of Valheim+
  - Fresh install of the Mod if it's not already installed
  - Will update an existing installation of Valheim+

### Full CFG editor

- Reads current values before applying mod updates, reapplies them to the new CFG and saves them.
- Edit all options and save before launching the game
- Easily see at-a-glance which sections are Enabled / Disabled
- Tooltips available on hover for most CFG options
- New CFG options are automatically supported whenever they are added

## Roadmap

- Highlight new options added to the CFG
- Validate/Verify CFG files -- no more silly CFG errors (kinda already does this, but not elegantly)
- Support for Server installations (windows first, maybe linux if the demand is there)
